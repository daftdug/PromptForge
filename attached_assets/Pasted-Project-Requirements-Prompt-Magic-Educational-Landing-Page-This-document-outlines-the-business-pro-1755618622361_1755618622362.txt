As a new user, I want to easily find the link to the training courses, so I can learn how to get the most out of the tool.

3. Technical Requirements Document (TRD)
3.1. Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React is a strong consideration for modular components and future scalability).

Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and consistent design.

Hosting: Replit, to enable rapid iteration and deployment.

3.2. Architecture:

A static, single-page application (SPA) model is sufficient for a marketing landing page.

All content should be hard-coded or served from a static asset bundle. No dynamic data from a backend is required for this landing page, unless a future version incorporates a live view of prompt stats.

3.3. Key Technical Considerations:

Performance: The page must load quickly on all devices. Images and assets should be optimized.

Responsiveness: The layout must be fully responsive and provide an excellent user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Accessibility: The page should meet basic accessibility standards (e.g., semantic HTML, alt text for images, high color contrast).

4. UI/UX & Design Requirements
4.1. Design Principles:

Aesthetics: The design must match the professional, dark theme seen in the screenshots of the training pages. It should be clean, modern, and visually appealing.

Simplicity: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users.

Consistency: All components (buttons, cards, typography) should be consistent with the established Prompt Magic brand identity.

4.2. Key Components & Layouts:

Header/Navigation: A sticky or fixed header with links to "Courses," "Prompts & Studio," "Quick Reference," "Community," and a user profile icon.

Hero Section: Full-width section with a title, subtitle, and prominent CTAs.

Feature Cards: A grid of cards with a central icon, a bold title, and a short description that explains the business benefit of the feature.

Social Proof Section: A horizontal row of three statistic cards with large, bold numbers.

Footer: A comprehensive footer with links to courses, resources, support, and social media icons, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Reddit (/r/promptingmagic).

4.3. Typography & Color Palette:

Typography: Utilize a clean, modern sans-serif font family.

Colors: Adhere to the existing dark theme palette, using shades of purple, blue, and white for text and highlights. A splash of bright, contrasting color for CTAs (e.g., orange) would be effective.
